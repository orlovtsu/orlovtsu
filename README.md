### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. I am going to explain interesting projects which I do as a Data Scientist.
Previously, I have got experience in many different fields from scientific programming to product management, and now I dive deep into Data Science and am happy to invite you to this fascinating world with me. 

If you have any questions about these projects or any additions, please, fill free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlovtsu/), email or phone.
